### Group Level

Choose a defined level according to your notification strategy. Default is "Critical" means notifying message in time.

### Template

Support Text content. You can pre-define your message template here. When you call `/send` API, you don't need to send entire message string every time, just using the variables.

For example, we pre-define a sentence contains a variable {name}.

![](/assets/Template2.png)So, when you call /send API, you just need to send the following body, you will receive a WeChat notification with entire message.

```
[
  {
    "groupId": "yer8agvrjl4b",
    "useTemplate": true,
    "variables": {"name": "Steven"}
  }
]
```
